          <h2>Your Friendly Neighborhood Web Developer</h2>
  
          <p>Having an interest in technology and the creative process growing up, I graduated with a degree in Media Studies from Loras College in 2017.
             After working as a photographer and account manager for over a year, I made the decision to attend Flatiron School.</p>
          <p>In January of 2020 I graduated Flatiron as a full stack web developer with an even greater passion for content creation. 
            With experience in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and React, I bring strong skills in front-end web development that help any size and type of company create powerful and compelling projects.</p>
